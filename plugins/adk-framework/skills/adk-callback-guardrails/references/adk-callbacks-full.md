# Design Patterns and Best Practices for Callbacks

Callbacks offer powerful hooks into the agent lifecycle. Here are common design patterns illustrating how to leverage them effectively in ADK, followed by best practices for implementation.

## Design Patterns

These patterns demonstrate typical ways to enhance or control agent behavior using callbacks:

### 1. Guardrails & Policy Enforcement

* **Pattern:** Intercept requests before they reach the LLM or tools to enforce rules.
* **How:** Use `before_model_callback` to inspect the `LlmRequest` prompt or `before_tool_callback` to inspect tool arguments. If a policy violation is detected (e.g., forbidden topics, profanity), return a predefined response (`LlmResponse` or `dict`/ `Map`) to block the operation and optionally update `context.state` to log the violation.
* **Example:** A `before_model_callback` checks `llm_request.contents` for sensitive keywords and returns a standard "Cannot process this request" `LlmResponse` if found, preventing the LLM call.

### 2. Dynamic State Management

* **Pattern:** Read from and write to session state within callbacks to make agent behavior context-aware and pass data between steps.
* **How:** Access `callback_context.state` or `tool_context.state`. Modifications (`state['key'] = value`) are automatically tracked in the subsequent `Event.actions.state_delta` for persistence by the `SessionService`.
* **Example:** An `after_tool_callback` saves a `transaction_id` from the tool's result to `tool_context.state['last_transaction_id']`. A later `before_agent_callback` might read `state['user_tier']` to customize the agent's greeting.

### 3. Logging and Monitoring

* **Pattern:** Add detailed logging at specific lifecycle points for observability and debugging.
* **How:** Implement callbacks (e.g., `before_agent_callback`, `after_tool_callback`, `after_model_callback`) to print or send structured logs containing information like agent name, tool name, invocation ID, and relevant data from the context or arguments.
* **Example:** Log messages like `INFO: [Invocation: e-123] Before Tool: search_api - Args: {'query': 'ADK'}`.

### 4. Caching

* **Pattern:** Avoid redundant LLM calls or tool executions by caching results.
* **How:** In `before_model_callback` or `before_tool_callback`, generate a cache key based on the request/arguments. Check `context.state` (or an external cache) for this key. If found, return the cached `LlmResponse` or result directly, skipping the actual operation. If not found, allow the operation to proceed and use the corresponding `after_` callback (`after_model_callback`, `after_tool_callback`) to store the new result in the cache using the key.
*   **Example:** `before_tool_callback` for `get_stock_price(symbol)` checks `state[f"cache:stock:{symbol}"]`. If present, returns the cached price; otherwise, allows the API call and `after_tool_callback` saves the result to the state key.

### 5. Request/Response Modification

* **Pattern:** Alter data just before it's sent to the LLM/tool or just after it's received.
* **How:**
    * `before_model_callback`: Modify `llm_request` (e.g., add system instructions based on `state`).
    * `after_model_callback`: Modify the returned `LlmResponse` (e.g., format text, filter content).
    *  `before_tool_callback`: Modify the tool `args` dictionary (or Map in Java).
    *  `after_tool_callback`: Modify the `tool_response` dictionary (or Map in Java).
* **Example:** `before_model_callback` appends "User language preference: Spanish" to `llm_request.config.system_instruction` if `context.state['lang'] == 'es'`.

### 6. Conditional Skipping of Steps

* **Pattern:** Prevent standard operations (agent run, LLM call, tool execution) based on certain conditions.
* **How:** Return a value from a `before_` callback (`Content` from `before_agent_callback`, `LlmResponse` from `before_model_callback`, `dict` from `before_tool_callback`). The framework interprets this returned value as the result for that step, skipping the normal execution.
* **Example:** `before_tool_callback` checks `tool_context.state['api_quota_exceeded']`. If `True`, it returns `{'error': 'API quota exceeded'}`, preventing the actual tool function from running.

### 7. Tool-Specific Actions (Authentication & Summarization Control)

* **Pattern:** Handle actions specific to the tool lifecycle, primarily authentication and controlling LLM summarization of tool results.
* **How:** Use `ToolContext` within tool callbacks (`before_tool_callback`, `after_tool_callback`).
    * **Authentication:** Call `tool_context.request_credential(auth_config)` in `before_tool_callback` if credentials are required but not found (e.g., via `tool_context.get_auth_response` or state check). This initiates the auth flow.
    * **Summarization:** Set `tool_context.actions.skip_summarization = True` if the raw dictionary output of the tool should be passed back to the LLM or potentially displayed directly, bypassing the default LLM summarization step.
* **Example:** A `before_tool_callback` for a secure API checks for an auth token in state; if missing, it calls `request_credential`. An `after_tool_callback` for a tool returning structured JSON might set `skip_summarization = True`.

### 8. Artifact Handling

* **Pattern:** Save or load session-related files or large data blobs during the agent lifecycle.
* **How:** Use `callback_context.save_artifact` / `await tool_context.save_artifact` to store data (e.g., generated reports, logs, intermediate data). Use `load_artifact` to retrieve previously stored artifacts. Changes are tracked via `Event.actions.artifact_delta`.
* **Example:** An `after_tool_callback` for a "generate_report" tool saves the output file using `await tool_context.save_artifact("report.pdf", report_part)`. A `before_agent_callback` might load a configuration artifact using `callback_context.load_artifact("agent_config.json")`.

## Best Practices for Callbacks

* **Keep Focused:** Design each callback for a single, well-defined purpose (e.g., just logging, just validation). Avoid monolithic callbacks.
* **Mind Performance:** Callbacks execute synchronously within the agent's processing loop. Avoid long-running or blocking operations (network calls, heavy computation). Offload if necessary, but be aware this adds complexity.
* **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Use `try...except/ catch` blocks within your callback functions. Log errors appropriately and decide if the agent invocation should halt or attempt recovery. Don't let callback errors crash the entire process.
* **Manage State Carefully:**
    * Be deliberate about reading from and writing to `context.state`. Changes are immediately visible within the *current* invocation and persisted at the end of the event processing.
    * Use specific state keys rather than modifying broad structures to avoid unintended side effects.
    *  Consider using state prefixes (`State.APP_PREFIX`, `State.USER_PREFIX`, `State.TEMP_PREFIX`) for clarity, especially with persistent `SessionService` implementations.
* **Consider Idempotency:** If a callback performs actions with external side effects (e.g., incrementing an external counter), design it to be idempotent (safe to run multiple times with the same input) if possible, to handle potential retries in the framework or your application.
* **Test Thoroughly:** Unit test your callback functions using mock context objects. Perform integration tests to ensure callbacks function correctly within the full agent flow.
* **Ensure Clarity:** Use descriptive names for your callback functions. Add clear docstrings explaining their purpose, when they run, and any side effects (especially state modifications).
* **Use Correct Context Type:** Always use the specific context type provided (`CallbackContext` for agent/model, `ToolContext` for tools) to ensure access to the appropriate methods and properties.

By applying these patterns and best practices, you can effectively use callbacks to create more robust, observable, and customized agent behaviors in ADK.

# Callbacks: Observe, Customize, and Control Agent Behavior

## Introduction: What are Callbacks and Why Use Them?

Callbacks are a cornerstone feature of ADK, providing a powerful mechanism to hook into an agent's execution process. They allow you to observe, customize, and even control the agent's behavior at specific, predefined points without modifying the core ADK framework code.

**What are they?** In essence, callbacks are standard functions that you define. You then associate these functions with an agent when you create it. The ADK framework automatically calls your functions at key stages, letting you observe or intervene. Think of it like checkpoints during the agent's process:

* **Before the agent starts its main work on a request, and after it finishes:** When you ask an agent to do something (e.g., answer a question), it runs its internal logic to figure out the response.
  * The `Before Agent` callback executes *right before* this main work begins for that specific request.
  * The `After Agent` callback executes *right after* the agent has finished all its steps for that request and has prepared the final result, but just before the result is returned.
  * This "main work" encompasses the agent's *entire* process for handling that single request. This might involve deciding to call an LLM, actually calling the LLM, deciding to use a tool, using the tool, processing the results, and finally putting together the answer. These callbacks essentially wrap the whole sequence from receiving the input to producing the final output for that one interaction.
* **Before sending a request to, or after receiving a response from, the Large Language Model (LLM):** These callbacks (`Before Model`, `After Model`) allow you to inspect or modify the data going to and coming from the LLM specifically.
* **Before executing a tool (like a Python function or another agent) or after it finishes:** Similarly, `Before Tool` and `After Tool` callbacks give you control points specifically around the execution of tools invoked by the agent.

**Why use them?** Callbacks unlock significant flexibility and enable advanced agent capabilities:

* **Observe & Debug:** Log detailed information at critical steps for monitoring and troubleshooting.  
* **Customize & Control:** Modify data flowing through the agent (like LLM requests or tool results) or even bypass certain steps entirely based on your logic.  
* **Implement Guardrails:** Enforce safety rules, validate inputs/outputs, or prevent disallowed operations.  
* **Manage State:** Read or dynamically update the agent's session state during execution.  
* **Integrate & Enhance:** Trigger external actions (API calls, notifications) or add features like caching.

**How are they added:**

## The Callback Mechanism: Interception and Control

When the ADK framework encounters a point where a callback can run (e.g., just before calling the LLM), it checks if you provided a corresponding callback function for that agent. If you did, the framework executes your function.

**Context is Key:** Your callback function isn't called in isolation. The framework provides special **context objects** (`CallbackContext` or `ToolContext`) as arguments. These objects contain vital information about the current state of the agent's execution, including the invocation details, session state, and potentially references to services like artifacts or memory. You use these context objects to understand the situation and interact with the framework. (See the dedicated "Context Objects" section for full details).

**Controlling the Flow (The Core Mechanism):** The most powerful aspect of callbacks lies in how their **return value** influences the agent's subsequent actions. This is how you intercept and control the execution flow:

1. **`return None` (Allow Default Behavior):**  

    * The specific return type can vary depending on the language. In Java, the equivalent return type is `Optional.empty()`. Refer to the API documentation for language specific guidance.
    * This is the standard way to signal that your callback has finished its work (e.g., logging, inspection, minor modifications to *mutable* input arguments like `llm_request`) and that the ADK agent should **proceed with its normal operation**.  
    * For `before_*` callbacks (`before_agent`, `before_model`, `before_tool`), returning `None` means the next step in the sequence (running the agent logic, calling the LLM, executing the tool) will occur.  
    * For `after_*` callbacks (`after_agent`, `after_model`, `after_tool`), returning `None` means the result just produced by the preceding step (the agent's output, the LLM's response, the tool's result) will be used as is.

2. **`return <Specific Object>` (Override Default Behavior):**  

    * Returning a *specific type of object* (instead of `None`) is how you **override** the ADK agent's default behavior. The framework will use the object you return and *skip* the step that would normally follow or *replace* the result that was just generated.  
    * **`before_agent_callback` → `types.Content`**: Skips the agent's main execution logic (`_run_async_impl` / `_run_live_impl`). The returned `Content` object is immediately treated as the agent's final output for this turn. Useful for handling simple requests directly or enforcing access control.  
    * **`before_model_callback` → `LlmResponse`**: Skips the call to the external Large Language Model. The returned `LlmResponse` object is processed as if it were the actual response from the LLM. Ideal for implementing input guardrails, prompt validation, or serving cached responses.  
    * **`before_tool_callback` → `dict` or `Map`**: Skips the execution of the actual tool function (or sub-agent). The returned `dict` is used as the result of the tool call, which is then typically passed back to the LLM. Perfect for validating tool arguments, applying policy restrictions, or returning mocked/cached tool results.  
    * **`after_agent_callback` → `types.Content`**: *Replaces* the `Content` that the agent's run logic just produced.  
    * **`after_model_callback` → `LlmResponse`**: *Replaces* the `LlmResponse` received from the LLM. Useful for sanitizing outputs, adding standard disclaimers, or modifying the LLM's response structure.  
    * **`after_tool_callback` → `dict` or `Map`**: *Replaces* the `dict` result returned by the tool. Allows for post-processing or standardization of tool outputs before they are sent back to the LLM.

**Conceptual Code Example (Guardrail):**

This example demonstrates the common pattern for a guardrail using `before_model_callback`.

By understanding this mechanism of returning `None` versus returning specific objects, you can precisely control the agent's execution path, making callbacks an essential tool for building sophisticated and reliable agents with ADK.


# Types of Callbacks

The framework provides different types of callbacks that trigger at various stages of an agent's execution. Understanding when each callback fires and what context it receives is key to using them effectively.

## Agent Lifecycle Callbacks

These callbacks are available on *any* agent that inherits from `BaseAgent` (including `LlmAgent`, `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, `LoopAgent`, etc).

!!! Note
    The specific method names or return types may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., return `None` in Python, return `Optional.empty()` or `Maybe.empty()` in Java). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### Before Agent Callback

**When:** Called *immediately before* the agent's `_run_async_impl` (or `_run_live_impl`) method is executed. It runs after the agent's `InvocationContext` is created but *before* its core logic begins.

**Purpose:** Ideal for setting up resources or state needed only for this specific agent's run, performing validation checks on the session state (callback\_context.state) before execution starts, logging the entry point of the agent's activity, or potentially modifying the invocation context before the core logic uses it.

**Note on the `before_agent_callback` Example:**

* **What it Shows:** This example demonstrates the `before_agent_callback`. This callback runs *right before* the agent's main processing logic starts for a given request.
* **How it Works:** The callback function (`check_if_agent_should_run`) looks at a flag (`skip_llm_agent`) in the session's state.
    * If the flag is `True`, the callback returns a `types.Content` object. This tells the ADK framework to **skip** the agent's main execution entirely and use the callback's returned content as the final response.
    * If the flag is `False` (or not set), the callback returns `None` or an empty object. This tells the ADK framework to **proceed** with the agent's normal execution (calling the LLM in this case).
* **Expected Outcome:** You'll see two scenarios:
    1. In the session *with* the `skip_llm_agent: True` state, the agent's LLM call is bypassed, and the output comes directly from the callback ("Agent... skipped...").
    2. In the session *without* that state flag, the callback allows the agent to run, and you see the actual response from the LLM (e.g., "Hello!").
* **Understanding Callbacks:** This highlights how `before_` callbacks act as **gatekeepers**, allowing you to intercept execution *before* a major step and potentially prevent it based on checks (like state, input validation, permissions).


### After Agent Callback

**When:** Called *immediately after* the agent's `_run_async_impl` (or `_run_live_impl`) method successfully completes. It does *not* run if the agent was skipped due to `before_agent_callback` returning content or if `end_invocation` was set during the agent's run.

**Purpose:** Useful for cleanup tasks, post-execution validation, logging the completion of an agent's activity, modifying final state, or augmenting/replacing the agent's final output.

**Note on the `after_agent_callback` Example:**

* **What it Shows:** This example demonstrates the `after_agent_callback`. This callback runs *right after* the agent's main processing logic has finished and produced its result, but *before* that result is finalized and returned.
* **How it Works:** The callback function (`modify_output_after_agent`) checks a flag (`add_concluding_note`) in the session's state.
    * If the flag is `True`, the callback returns a *new* `types.Content` object. This tells the ADK framework to **replace** the agent's original output with the content returned by the callback.
    * If the flag is `False` (or not set), the callback returns `None` or an empty object. This tells the ADK framework to **use** the original output generated by the agent.
*   **Expected Outcome:** You'll see two scenarios:
    1. In the session *without* the `add_concluding_note: True` state, the callback allows the agent's original output ("Processing complete!") to be used.
    2. In the session *with* that state flag, the callback intercepts the agent's original output and replaces it with its own message ("Concluding note added...").
* **Understanding Callbacks:** This highlights how `after_` callbacks allow **post-processing** or **modification**. You can inspect the result of a step (the agent's run) and decide whether to let it pass through, change it, or completely replace it based on your logic.

## LLM Interaction Callbacks

These callbacks are specific to `LlmAgent` and provide hooks around the interaction with the Large Language Model.

### Before Model Callback

**When:** Called just before the `generate_content_async` (or equivalent) request is sent to the LLM within an `LlmAgent`'s flow.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of the request going to the LLM. Use cases include adding dynamic instructions, injecting few-shot examples based on state, modifying model config, implementing guardrails (like profanity filters), or implementing request-level caching.

**Return Value Effect:**  
If the callback returns `None` (or a `Maybe.empty()` object in Java), the LLM continues its normal workflow. If the callback returns an `LlmResponse` object, then the call to the LLM is **skipped**. The returned `LlmResponse` is used directly as if it came from the model. This is powerful for implementing guardrails or caching.

### After Model Callback

**When:** Called just after a response (`LlmResponse`) is received from the LLM, before it's processed further by the invoking agent.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection or modification of the raw LLM response. Use cases include

* logging model outputs,
* reformatting responses,
* censoring sensitive information generated by the model,
* parsing structured data from the LLM response and storing it in `callback_context.state`
* or handling specific error codes.

## Tool Execution Callbacks

These callbacks are also specific to `LlmAgent` and trigger around the execution of tools (including `FunctionTool`, `AgentTool`, etc.) that the LLM might request.

### Before Tool Callback

**When:** Called just before a specific tool's `run_async` method is invoked, after the LLM has generated a function call for it.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of tool arguments, performing authorization checks before execution, logging tool usage attempts, or implementing tool-level caching.

**Return Value Effect:**

1. If the callback returns `None` (or a `Maybe.empty()` object in Java), the tool's `run_async` method is executed with the (potentially modified) `args`.  
2. If a dictionary (or `Map` in Java) is returned, the tool's `run_async` method is **skipped**. The returned dictionary is used directly as the result of the tool call. This is useful for caching or overriding tool behavior.

### After Tool Callback

**When:** Called just after the tool's `run_async` method completes successfully.

**Purpose:** Allows inspection and modification of the tool's result before it's sent back to the LLM (potentially after summarization). Useful for logging tool results, post-processing or formatting results, or saving specific parts of the result to the session state.

**Return Value Effect:**

1. If the callback returns `None` (or a `Maybe.empty()` object in Java), the original `tool_response` is used.  
2. If a new dictionary is returned, it **replaces** the original `tool_response`. This allows modifying or filtering the result seen by the LLM.
